                <h2>About the client</h2>
                <p>Pearls of Motherhood is a blog about motherhood, parenting and well-being, founded by Gabriella Ignácz (MA, MSc, BA(Hons)), an English writer who believes in a holistic approach to motherhood, where the wellbeing of mother and child is based on multidimensional perspectives including physical, psychological and spiritual.</p>

                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>When Gabriella reached out to me, she had an existing Wordpress blog that just wasn’t meeting her needs, it was running on an outdated version of Wordpress, bloated with many plugins and outdated theme. As a result, the blog was suffering from slow performance, low traffic, lack of user engagement and difficulty in managing its content.</p>
                <p>I managed to do a complete rebuild of the blog in terms of design and content structure. I created a brand new design for her blog based on her color preferences and the nature of the blog, then implemented it into a fully functional/responsive WordPress site running the latest stable version of Wordpress. The new theme was developed using Genesis Framework (a secure, solid and search-engine-optimized foundation for building Wordpress themes).</p>
                <p>I also developed a custom Wordpress plugin that extends Wordpress functionality with 4 custom widgets and some UI changes to the Wordpress admin panel .</p>
                <p>This resulted in a noticeable increase in traffic, usability, user experience and visitor engagement.</p>
