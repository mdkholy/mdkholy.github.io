                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>My main role in producing Innovation Factory's public website was to take the designs mockups provided by their designer and turn them into a fully functional/responsive WordPress site. I converted their designs into a W3C-valid HTML/CSS version using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery, then implemented it into a Wordpress theme using Genesis Framework (a secure, solid and search-engine-optimized foundation for building Wordpress themes).</p>
                <p>Another important aspect of the project was to develop a custom Wordpress plugin to extend Wordpress functionality to allow them easily manage all the site content though the Wordpress admin dashboard, this includes blog articles, slideshow images, their partners, their clients, team members and some custom designed pages with in-page navigation. The plugin was developed using PHP5 according to Wordpress plugin development standards and best practices.</p>
                <p>The final phase of the project involved designing and developing a custom newsletter email template (to be used in Mailchimp) that matches the website look and feel.</p>
