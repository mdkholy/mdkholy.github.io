                <h2>About the client</h2>
                <p>NAIOP, the Commercial Real Estate Development Association, is the leading organization for developers, owners and related professionals in office, industrial, retail and mixed-use real estate. NAIOP provides unparalleled industry networking and education, and advocates for effective legislation on behalf of our members. NAIOP advances responsible, sustainable development that creates jobs and benefits the communities in which our members work and live.</p>

                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>The NAIOP Canada Sustainability Blog is a microsite for 3 NAIOP Chapters in Canada; NAIOP Vancouver, NAIOP Calgary and NAIOP Greater Toronto. The blog acts as a portal for all three Chapters and features case studies of various member projects, articles relating to sustainability in the real estate/development industry and special events. Members also have the ability to submit articles and case studies via a secure frontend submission interface.</p>
                <p>My main role in this project was to take the designs mockups provided by our in-house designer and turn them into a fully functional/responsive WordPress site. I converted their designs into a W3C-valid HTML/CSS version, then implemented it into a Wordpress theme using Genesis Framework (a secure, solid and search-engine-optimized foundation for building Wordpress themes).</p>
                <p>The site is managed by various members from the three NAIOP chapters in Canada. There is an overall site administrator and people designated to administer article and project case study submissions. So I built a custom Wordpress plugin to extend Wordpress functionality to allow having several site administrators with different premissions and access levels. I also built a custom notification system that notifies admins based on their access level about new submissions for approval.</p>
